            <p>
              As part of the IEEE community, I volunteered at an educational event hosted by a local 
              private school, demonstrating electronics and AI technologies to students. Our booth 
              featured interactive demonstrations including a robotic arm and an autonomous fire-detection 
              car robot, inspiring young minds to explore technology and engineering.
