          <p>
            This first lecture reset my mindset about what it means to work in tech: it's not just coding and grades. Dr. Ahmad emphasized that real work depends heavily on understanding project management language, organizational expectations, and how decisions are made in professional environments. He backed this up with real-life examples of both successful and failed projects, which made the course immediately feel grounded and practical.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest takeaway was the "trilogy" every project must respect: cost, time, and scope. Seeing these as a constant balancing act (not three independent things) made it clear why projects often fail even when the technical work is solid. If you ignore one side of the triangle, it shows up somewhere else—and usually as a painful surprise.

          <p>
            This lecture went deeper into what makes a project succeed beyond just finishing tasks. A project manager needs to understand the 10 knowledge areas of project management (from the PMBOK framework) and use them to guide the project toward the original goals that were defined at the start. A point that stood out: sometimes stopping (terminating) a failing project is actually the successful decision, because continuing can waste time, money, and credibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also discussed stakeholders and how "success" is not a single definition. Different stakeholders can care about different outcomes (delivery date, cost, quality, reputation, customer impact), and the project manager must navigate these priorities. I liked the reminder that a company is not judged by one failure; we used Microsoft's mobile effort as an example of a project failure that did not define the company's overall success.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another valuable concept was the difference between development and production environments. A development environment is where features are built, tested, and changed safely without real users being affected; it's meant for experimentation, debugging, and iteration. A production environment is the live system used by real users, where stability, security, and reliability are non-negotiable. The university registration system example (including the demonstration using a student ID, Fares Hatahet) made this distinction concrete instead of theoretical.

            This short online video reinforced the second lecture: the 10 project management knowledge areas are not just theory—they're the practical toolbox a project manager needs to coordinate people, scope, timelines, risk, communication, and delivery. Seeing them again helped me connect the idea that a PM's job is fundamentally integration: combining efforts across stakeholders so the project moves as one system instead of disconnected parts.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also pushed an important point: successful projects are not the final goal by themselves. Projects are vehicles for enterprise success, and stakeholder satisfaction is part of that chain. If the project creates value for stakeholders and aligns with organizational strategy, the project contributes to long-term business results rather than being a one-time delivery.

          <p>
            This lecture clarified the meaning of "portfolio" depending on context. For us as students, a portfolio is evidence of work, learning, and growth. In organizations, project portfolio management (PPM) is about selecting and managing the right set of projects to maximize value, align with strategy, and manage risk across the organization. That difference matters because it changes how you evaluate what belongs in a portfolio and how you prioritize work.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also discussed the role of the project manager, what the job description looks like, and the six traits Dr. Ahmad highlighted for effective project managers. Even without memorizing the traits word-for-word, the message was clear: strong project managers don't just track tasks—they create clarity, reduce chaos, and keep people aligned under pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The definitions of project, program, and portfolio were also made clearer. A project is a temporary effort with a specific goal and outcome. A program is a coordinated group of related projects managed together to achieve benefits that you wouldn't get if you managed them separately. A portfolio sits above programs and projects: it's the full collection of initiatives an organization chooses to invest in, balanced across priorities, risk, and strategy. Finally, the PMI Talent Triangle tied it all together: Technical Project Management skills, Strategic & Business Management skills, and Leadership skills. The point was straightforward: without leadership and business thinking, technical competence alone won't carry a project.

          <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong></p>
          <p>
            This lecture made one message impossible to ignore: treating an IT project as a purely technical assignment is a reliable way to fail. Projects exist inside systems—business strategy, organizational structure, culture, leadership, and stakeholder expectations. The systems approach (philosophy, analysis, and management) framed this clearly: you have to understand the environment, analyze how parts interact, and then manage it intentionally rather than hoping things "work out."
          </p>
          <p>
            A key insight was that many project failures happen for non-technical reasons: weak leadership, unhealthy culture, poor stakeholder management, and lack of executive commitment. We also connected this to organizational structure—functional, project-based, and matrix organizations each change how authority, communication, and speed work, and those differences directly affect delivery outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lecture also covered life cycles: project life cycle vs. product life cycle, and how SDLC models (Waterfall, Spiral, RAD) fit into planning and risk. Early phases carry the highest risk but also the highest influence—choices made early shape cost, scope, and feasibility later. The bottom line was clear: ignoring the organizational and managerial side isn't a small weakness; it's a guaranteed failure path.

          <p><strong>Topics Discussed:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Waterfall model as a sequential SDLC approach</li>
            <li>Typical phases (requirements through maintenance)</li>

          <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong></p>
          <p>
            This online video focused on the Waterfall model and its sequential nature: each phase is completed before the next one begins, and the output of one phase becomes the input of the next. The phases were explained at a high level as requirements (understanding what needs to be built), design (planning how it will be built), implementation (building the system), testing (verifying correctness and catching defects), deployment (releasing to the real environment), and maintenance (supporting and improving after release).
          </p>
          <p>
            What clicked for me is why Waterfall can feel stable: it forces structure, documentation, and clear checkpoints. But that same structure creates a weakness—late changes become expensive and risky because earlier phases are already "locked." So Waterfall can work well when requirements are stable and well understood, but it becomes painful in fast-changing environments where feedback and iteration are constant.

          <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong></p>
          <p>
            This video drew a sharp contrast between the traditional Waterfall model and Agile methodology. Waterfall treats the product as one unit and forces strict phase dependency, which makes changes high-risk and can require re-running large parts of the development cycle. It also highlighted how deployment in this approach can involve downtime, which becomes a serious problem for modern systems that need continuous availability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Agile was presented as a practical solution to these limitations by breaking delivery into smaller increments (even described in the video using microservices/phased delivery), enabling frequent updates "on the go" with less downtime. The focus shifts toward stakeholder feedback, trial versions, and consumer needs—Adobe's beta releases were mentioned as an example of this mindset. The video also referenced business impact examples: Cisco reducing defects by 40% and Sony saving $30 million annually by reducing planning time and downtime. The overall conclusion was that the Agile Manifesto supports the flexibility required for today's fast-changing environments.

          <p>
            This lecture emphasized how much the developer environment matters in real teams. Dr. Ahmad gave a clear hiring example: if a student is experienced in PHP but the university development team works in .NET, the mismatch becomes a long-term operational risk. If the student joins and later drops out, the team is stuck with a gap that is hard to replace because the environment and stack require a specific skill fit. The lesson was blunt but realistic: teams avoid avoidable risk, and technology alignment is part of stability.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also had a small off-topic moment about the pronunciation of the word "opportunity," which honestly made the lecture feel more human and relaxed.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end, we briefly touched on data flow charts. Even though we didn't go deep, the key idea was that they help describe how data moves through a system: from external entities into processes, into data stores, and back out as outputs. We also discussed how you can convert a flow chart into a paragraph description (and vice versa), which matters because documentation often needs both a visual map and a written explanation depending on the audience.

          <p>
            This video focused on Scrum and explained why it works as a modern alternative to Waterfall. Instead of long planning phases and slow feedback, Scrum runs in short 1–3 week cycles called Sprints. The goal is not perfection at the end of the year—it's delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of every cycle with "just enough" planning to move forward safely.
          </p>
          <p>
            The structure was explained clearly through the three pillars of Scrum. Roles: the Product Owner defines and prioritizes features, the Scrum Master protects the process as a servant leader, and the Team builds the product. Artifacts: the Product Backlog holds prioritized user stories, the Sprint Backlog captures what the team commits to this Sprint, and Burndown Charts visualize progress. Ceremonies: Sprint Planning sets the increment, the Daily Scrum surfaces blockers, and the Sprint Review/Retrospective validates results and improves the process. Repeating this loop is what enables faster delivery while staying aligned with real market and stakeholder needs.

          <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong></p>
          <p>
            We continued with flow charts and why they make work easier. A major point was that a strong programmer can translate a flow chart into code regardless of language, because the logic is what matters. We also discussed that flow charts aren't forced to be strictly top-to-bottom; they can branch, loop, and represent real decision paths as long as the flow remains consistent and readable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we moved into UML: what it is, how it helps, what its components are, and how to draw it properly for managing a project. I learned that actors in UML are not limited to humans. Every user is an actor, but not every actor is a user—an external system can be an actor too. Dr. Ahmad even emphasized that UML should be drawn simply using black stick figures (he explicitly said "black stickmen boy"). When he asked about the university system, we identified the student as an example of an actor.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also had a brief mention of smoke testing. The core idea is that it's an initial, basic check to confirm a build or system is stable enough to proceed with deeper testing. The name comes from the idea of catching obvious failures early—like turning something on and seeing if it literally "smokes" or immediately breaks—before investing time in detailed test cycles.

The main idea was that improvement starts with accuracy: before you fix a system, you must capture its current "as-is" state through process mapping. Without that baseline, you risk optimizing something that isn't real.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also explained a standard visual language: ellipses for start/end, rectangles for activities (like picking or packing), diamonds for decision points with yes/no outcomes, and arrows for direction. The video mentioned more advanced additions like subprocesses, documents, and connectors. I liked the distinction between macro process maps (management-level overview) and swim lane diagrams that separate "who does what" by grouping tasks by responsible party.
          </p>
          <p>
            A practical reminder at the end was that flow charts are great for visualization, but they are usually paired with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) because people need step-by-step detail for training, not just a diagram.

            This lecture included a direct discussion about AI, framed as a trend or even a "bubble" rather than guaranteed long-term value. We also talked about majors in general and how many paths eventually trace back to computer science foundations. Whether I fully agree or not, the discussion was useful because it forced a more strategic view: hype can drive decisions, but organizations still need to invest based on real value and long-term capability, not excitement.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then introduced SWOT analysis in a project management context. SWOT organizes thinking into Strengths and Weaknesses (internal factors) and Opportunities and Threats (external factors). What made it feel practical is that it's not just a business exercise—it supports project decisions too: whether a project should start, how it should be positioned, where risks are hiding, and what capabilities need to be strengthened. Done properly, SWOT becomes a structured way to align stakeholders around reality instead of assumptions.

            This short video focused specifically on SWOT analysis and reinforced the main idea from the previous lecture: SWOT is only useful when it leads to decisions, not when it stays as a list. It clarified how strengths and weaknesses describe internal reality (resources, skills, constraints), while opportunities and threats describe external reality (market shifts, competitors, technology changes, regulations).
          </p>
          <p>
            What I took from it is that SWOT can be used like a filter before committing to a project: it helps you see whether the project is leveraging real strengths, whether weaknesses are likely to cause delays or failure, and whether external threats can disrupt delivery. It also pushes you to act on opportunities intentionally rather than noticing them too late.

          <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong></p>
          <p>
            This video focused on project scheduling using the PERT/CPM method to identify the Critical Path. It starts by building a network where each activity node includes its duration and four timing values: Earliest Start (ES), Earliest Finish (EF), Latest Start (LS), and Latest Finish (LF). Those values turn scheduling from guesswork into a structured analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The process relies on two phases. The forward pass finds the minimum completion time by calculating ES and EF for each task; when a task has multiple predecessors, its ES is the highest EF among them. The backward pass works from the end to calculate LS and LF, where the LF of an activity becomes the minimum LS of its successors.
          </p>
          <p>
            From these values you calculate slack (LS minus ES), which shows how long an activity can be delayed without affecting the final delivery date. Activities with zero slack are critical, forming the Critical Path. Because this path defines the project's duration, any delay on it directly delays the project.

          <p>
            This lecture reinforced the idea that the Critical Path is not just a calculation—it's a control tool. It tells you which activities are truly "time-sensitive" and which ones have flexibility (slack). That matters because not all delays are equal: a delay on a non-critical task might be manageable, but a delay on a critical activity immediately pushes the entire project completion date.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I appreciated is how this changes day-to-day management. Instead of treating every task as equally urgent, the critical path helps prioritize attention, monitoring, and escalation. It gives a rational basis for decision-making when resources are limited: protect the critical activities first, and manage non-critical tasks using slack without creating panic or wasting effort.

          <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong></p>
          <p>
            This lecture continued the AI discussion, and Dr. Ahmad repeated a strong position: AI is a bubble and a trend that will eventually fade. He supported that view by referencing his background (including that his master's thesis was in machine learning), and he framed AI as not "real" intelligence because it lacks consciousness—meaning it doesn't understand the world, it predicts patterns based on data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if someone disagrees with the conclusion, the framing was valuable because it forces a clearer definition: what do we actually mean by intelligence, and what do these systems truly do? In a project management context, the practical takeaway is to separate useful tools from marketing hype. A predictive machine can still be valuable for forecasting, risk signals, estimation support, and automation—but relying on it as if it has judgment or accountability is a category mistake. Projects succeed when people make disciplined decisions and manage change, not when they blindly trust trends.

          <p>
            This reading explored the career insights of Dr. Mike Clayton and presented project management as a craft rather than a purely technical discipline. The central argument was that PM is fundamentally about managing people, expectations, and change. Technical understanding helps, but success depends more on leadership, communication, and the ability to create structure when situations are messy.
          </p>
          <p>
            A core model discussed was ShuHaRi: Shu (learning in a structured way by following the rules), Ha (applying that learning within established frameworks), and Ri (using full knowledge to innovate and create something new). I liked this because it frames growth realistically: mastery isn't instant—it's a progression from discipline to adaptation to creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reading also raised a serious point about professionalization, especially because of high failure rates in major projects (particularly in the public sector). A standout idea was that project managers must learn to "speak truth to power"—to challenge unrealistic parameters and political pressure instead of silently accepting impossible targets. The career advice was also grounded: strong PM careers are built over time through patience, resilience, and the ability to create order out of chaos.
