            <h3>Assignment Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This assignment required our team to research and create a comprehensive document on Testing & Validation 
                in IT Project Management. We explored fundamental concepts, roles, and applications of testing and validation 
                throughout the software development lifecycle, examining how these activities contribute to project success, 
                quality assurance, and stakeholder confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The assignment covered the relationship between testing and validation, their roles in different SDLC models 
                (Waterfall vs. Agile), levels of testing, validation techniques, common challenges, and best practices. The 
                deliverable was a well-structured academic document with proper citations and references.
            </p>
            
            <h3>My Work</h3>
            <p>
                As part of a five-member team, I contributed to researching and writing the comprehensive document on Testing 
                & Validation. Our collaborative approach involved dividing research topics among team members, with each person 
                focusing on specific sections while maintaining consistency in writing style and formatting.
            </p>
            <p>
                My primary responsibility was researching and writing the section on "Levels of Testing and Software Testing Life 
                Cycle (STLC)". This section covered:
            </p>
            <ul class="assignment-features">
                <li><strong>Levels of Testing:</strong> Explained the four main levels - Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, and Acceptance Testing - including their purposes and who performs each level</li>
                <li><strong>Logical Grouped Types of Testing:</strong> Documented various testing types including Sanity Testing, Regression Testing, Smoke Testing, Performance Testing, Usability Testing, and Security Testing</li>
                <li><strong>Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC):</strong> Described the structured process that ensures systematic testing and validation of software quality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I also contributed to other sections including the introduction, objectives, and the relationship between 
                testing/validation and requirements engineering. Additionally, I participated in reviewing and editing the 
                document to ensure clarity, accuracy, and proper academic formatting.
            </p>
            <p>
                One key challenge was distinguishing between testing (verification) and validation. Through research, we clarified 
                that testing asks "Did we build the system right?" while validation asks "Did we build the right system?" 
                Another important learning was understanding that fixing errors after product release can cost 4-5 times more than 
                during design, highlighting the critical importance of early and continuous testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                This assignment reinforced how testing and validation are essential project management practices requiring proper 
                planning, resource allocation, and stakeholder involvement. It directly relates to course material on project 
                quality management, risk management, and the importance of early defect detection and prevention.

            <h3>Assignment Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This assignment required creating a comprehensive academic portfolio website that showcases 
                my work, reflections, and learning journey throughout the IT Project Management course. 
                The portfolio serves as a digital representation of my academic progress and demonstrates 
                my understanding of project management principles through practical application.
            </p>
            <p>
                The portfolio needed to include multiple pages covering core components such as personal 
                information, lecture reflections, assignments, extracurricular activities, technical and 
                soft skills, favorite IT links, and contact information. The website should demonstrate 
                professional web design principles, clear organization, and effective navigation.
            </p>
            
            <h3>My Work</h3>
            <p>
                I developed a complete portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design features 
                a modern, clean interface with a green and yellow color scheme that reflects my personality 
                while maintaining professionalism. The website includes a dark mode toggle for better user 
                experience and accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key features implemented include:
            </p>
            <ul class="assignment-features">
                <li><strong>Home Page:</strong> Profile information, student details, course information, and inspirational quotes with audio playback</li>
                <li><strong>Activities & Video Page:</strong> Extracurricular activities, volunteering work, student activities, conferences, hobbies, technical skills, and soft skills, along with an introductory video</li>
                <li><strong>CV Page:</strong> Embedded PDF curriculum vitae for easy viewing and download</li>
                <li><strong>Reflections Page:</strong> Comprehensive lecture reflections organized by date, covering all 22 lectures with topics discussed and personal insights</li>
                <li><strong>Assignments Page:</strong> Documentation of all course assignments with descriptions and deliverables</li>
                <li><strong>IT Links Page:</strong> Curated list of favorite IT-related websites with explanations</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Page:</strong> Multiple contact methods and professional links</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The website demonstrates strong organizational structure, visual simplicity, content clarity, 
                and consistent formatting throughout all pages. I utilized modern CSS techniques including 
                glassmorphism effects, smooth animations, and responsive design to ensure the portfolio 
                looks professional on all devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this project, I applied project management principles such as planning, organization, 
                time management, and iterative improvement. The portfolio itself serves as evidence of my 
                ability to manage a web development project from conception to completion, demonstrating 
                both technical skills and project management competencies.
