        <p>
          Below are some of my favorite IT-related resources. Each link includes
          a brief explanation of why I find it useful for learning and
          professional development.

          >
          <p>
            GitHub is an essential platform for version control and
            collaborative software development. It's useful for managing code
            repositories, contributing to open-source projects, and showcasing
            programming work. The platform also provides valuable learning
            resources and community support for developers.

            >ChatGPT</a
          >
          <p>
            ChatGPT is a powerful AI assistant that helps with coding,
            debugging, learning new concepts, and solving technical problems.
            It's particularly useful for understanding complex algorithms,
            generating code examples, explaining documentation, and getting
            instant answers to programming questions. As an AI student, I find
            it invaluable for learning and development workflows.

          <p>
            PyTorch is a leading deep learning framework that I use extensively
            in my AI research and projects. It provides an intuitive interface
            for building neural networks, with excellent support for dynamic
            computation graphs and GPU acceleration. The comprehensive
            documentation, tutorials, and active community make it essential for
            anyone working in machine learning and deep learning.

            >DeepLearning.ai</a
          >
          <p>
            DeepLearning.ai, founded by Andrew Ng, offers world-class courses on
            AI and machine learning. The platform provides structured learning
            paths from beginner to advanced levels, covering topics like deep
            learning, neural networks, and practical AI applications. The
            courses are well-designed with hands-on projects that help build
            real-world skills. It's an excellent resource for staying updated
            with the latest AI developments and best practices.

            >Pandas Documentation</a
          >
          <p>
            Pandas is a fundamental library for data manipulation and analysis
            in Python. The official documentation is comprehensive and
            well-organized, providing detailed explanations of functions,
            methods, and best practices. I frequently reference it when working
            with datasets, preprocessing data for machine learning models, and
            performing data analysis. It's an indispensable resource for any
            data science or AI project.
